A Game of Thrones
by George R. R. Martin

# This is an excerpt taken from the Game of Thrones.

Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned Stark reuniting with his dying sister Lyanna Stark in the Tower of Joy. 

Walking forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words.

"His name is [...] If Robert finds out, he'll kill him. You know he will. You have to protect him. 
Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
â€•Lyanna Stark to her brother Ned, speaking of her son [...].

Ned had brought Lyanna's child with him to Winterfell and claimed him as his bastard son to keep him safe.

Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar Targaryen never raped Lyanna. She loved
him and ran off with him, and bore him a son, Aegon Targaryen, making the bastard "Jon Snow" not only legitimate 
but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
