What if there was a world where having Superpowers wasn't rare? 
What if most of the people had some sort of power?


Sounds exiciting right! Well,not for everyone that is.


John was one of the brightest of the kids.He used to shine among his peers,
he thought the world was a really good place to live in. Well that was till he grew up.


  
The friends who flocked over John due to his brillance started avoiding him.
The ones who dispised him started bullying him. Why you ask,the reason is simple,
the same John who was bright and brillaint in his youth became a cripple adult without any 
superpower in a world where it was common.
