The wise man.

The wise man was a very calm person.

People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems 
every time. 
One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter.

After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only some of 
them laughed.
When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore.

The wise man smiled and said:
 
“You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. 
So why are you always crying about the same problem?”

 

Moral of the story:
Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy.
