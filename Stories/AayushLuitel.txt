          Dream


Rahul woke up from his sleep by sudden banging in the door. He opens it but 
sees noone there. He goes downstairs to drink some water and suddenly hears
a loud banging in his door. He goes to check his room with a little fear 
in him and opens the door. He looks at the open window and ..... he wakes up.
It was a dream within a dream. He was shocked. He couldn't believe his eyes. He couldn't believe what was happening.
