My first experience of snow
As we know, unplanned tours are the most fun ones. This tour was also unplanned. We were going to visit Kalinchowk Bhagwati temple. We weren't expecting to see snow. When we reached Kuri Village, it started snowing and roads were slippery. So, we had to walk to our resort. The walk to the resort was challenging as the vision was not that clear and the roads were slippery. Seeing snow was exciting but I was scared at first glance. The next morning, we hiked to the temple. It was freezing that morning. The temple was at the top of the hill and when we reached there it started snowing and the stairs were slippery. The view from the top of the hill was astonishing. This experience of snow was fun but it was full of challenges. So, life without challenges is boring.
