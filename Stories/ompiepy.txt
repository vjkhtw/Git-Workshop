The selfish world

A guy was in desperete need of the money for the operation of his mother.
He went bank to take loan, he was rejected. He called all his friends and
relatives, but none helped. He thought of asking to return the money
he has lended to others. He didn't got either, he was threatened instead.

He was punished for helping others. His mother died. There is no one
present in your need. Be selfish for yourself and your parents.
