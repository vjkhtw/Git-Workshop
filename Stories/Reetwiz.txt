"Viktor! your intentions are pure wicked.
Nature has eyes fixed on each and every one of your movement.
Challenge its surveillance and you shall be hit by karma."

"Charles...you poor little coward,
Watch me whip the horn off this filthy creature as you enjoy its screeches.
Don't expect for a share after I sell that thing."

Charles returned to the driver's seat, refraining from the sight of his
companion stealthily approaching the rhinoceros.

Just when Viktor scaled the creature with his shotgun, a fiercing growl rumbled
across the forest. Viktor turned around at the source. The very thing he
desired sent him to the depths of hell.
